You Do It is an app designed to eliminate awkward roommate to roommate interactions.  These interactions can involve either money or household chores.  This app allows the user to keep track of how much money they owe each roommate or how much their roommates owe them.  The money portion of the app requires the user to enter how much they spent, what they spent it on, and who the bill is to be split amongst.  Each roommate that is involved in that transaction will be notified and the transaction will also appear in their history.  It also enables the user to notify their roommates how much work they have been doing around the apartment.   This part of the app simply requires the user to enter what chore they did and rate how hard/nasty it was on a nastiness scale.  The simplicity of this app will allow users to update their money and chores status easily and quickly notify their roommates.
